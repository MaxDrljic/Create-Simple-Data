# Create-Simple-Data

Simple application where you can find one input field and type the string you want to display. VueJS is used on the front-end & the PostService is written in plain JavaScript which uses Axios to communicate with the server.

NodeJS & Express is used for the server. For the database I am using MongoDB hosted on mLab.
